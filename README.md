Introduction
The EDA Final Project aims to explore, visualize, and draw insights from a dataset using Python and its libraries. The project is divided into several stages, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Exploratory Data Analysis is crucial in understanding the structure and patterns within the data before building predictive models or making business decisions.

Project Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the dependencies using pip and the requirements.txt file (if available) or install the libraries manually.

Step-by-step installation:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/jayanth0706/EDAFinalProject.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd EDAFinalProject

Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, if there’s no requirements.txt file, manually install the dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open FinalProject.ipynb in the Jupyter environment and run the analysis.

Dataset
Source: The dataset used for this project can either be included in the data/ folder or downloaded from an external source.
Description: The dataset contains [add description here: e.g., sales data, customer demographics, etc.].
Columns:
Column 1: Description of column 1
Column 2: Description of column 2
Column 3: Description of column 3
... and so on.



Technologies Used
This project makes use of the following technologies and libraries:

Python: The main programming language used for analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn (optional): If used for any machine learning models or feature engineering.
Usage



You can explore the Jupyter notebooks in this repository for the following purposes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
Data visualizations using various types of plots (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.)
Optional: Model training and evaluation (if included)
Example commands:
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jayanth0706/EDAFinalProject.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd EDAFinalProject

# Open Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
Run the cells in FinalProject.ipynb step-by-step to see the analysis and visualizations.
